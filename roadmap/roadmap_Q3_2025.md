# 📅 Parklytics Roadmap – Q3 2025
🗓 July–September 2025  
🎯 Focus: Dashboard Visual Enhancements, Planner Integration, and Core Stability

---

## ✅ Top Priorities (Now / Actively Working On)
- [ ] Implement dynamic hourly trend graphs for each park based on park opening/closing/extended hours
- [ ] Adjust historical hourly trend graphs to align with real closing hours (not hardcoded to 11:00pm)
- [ ] Standardize and compact Park Info Cards to consistent size/spacing
- [ ] Make "Closed Attractions" in Today's Snapshot expandable (click/tap to reveal list)
- [ ] Add 2:00am full data reconnection routine to resolve stale data bug
- [ ] Add top navigation link to Planner tab
- [ ] Clean up Park Bag Checklist UX to actually build a selected list
- [ ] Begin trip packing list UI for clothes/gear (basic version)
- [ ] Finalize crowd index summary integration in dashboard layout
- [ ] Continue final wiring and layout polish of `alt_dashboard` v2

---

## 🟡 In Progress / Queued Next
- [ ] Search functionality to retrieve historical trends for specific rides
- [ ] Start initial testing of itinerary redesign approach
- [ ] Fix water bottle station page – rework layout, improve clarity

---

## 🕹️ Notes / Considerations
- Keep code monolithic during Q3 to avoid blocking active layout work
- Defer mobile design and layout responsiveness until Q4
- Branding/tagline polish should wait until layout/content stabilize

---

## 🟪 Deferred to Q4+
- [ ] Refactor dashboard into modular components (see `Q4 roadmap`)
- [ ] Full Itinerary overhaul
- [ ] Begin AWS migration planning
