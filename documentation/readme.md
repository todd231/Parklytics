## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* SQLite database with Disney World data

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components requests sqlite3 python-dateutil
```

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Update the database path in the code:

   ```python
   db_path = r"path/to/your/live.db"
   ```
4. Configure OpenWeatherMap API:

   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key"
   ZIP = "32830,US"  # Disney World area zip code
   ```

## Database Schema

The application expects a SQLite database with the following tables:

### entities

* id: Primary key
* name: Attraction/entity name
* type: ATTRACTION, SHOW, etc.
* park: Park name (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom)

### queue\_status

* entity\_id: Foreign key to entities table
* wait\_minutes: Wait time in minutes
* timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp
* status: OPERATING, CLOSED, REFURBISHMENT
* lightning\_lane\_available: Boolean
* lightning\_lane\_cost: Cost in cents

### schedule

* entity\_id: Foreign key to entities table
* date: Schedule date
* start\_time: Start time (ISO 8601)
* end\_time: End time (ISO 8601)
* type: OPERATING, TICKETED\_EVENT, INFO
* description: Schedule description

### purchases

* park\_entity\_id: Foreign key to entities table
* name: Purchase name (e.g., "Genie+", "Individual Lightning Lane")
* purchase\_type: Type of purchase
* price\_amount: Price in cents
* price\_currency: Currency code
* available: Boolean availability

## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
python app_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:8051](http://localhost:8051)

### Dashboard Sections

1. Weather Report: Current conditions at Disney World
2. Today's Park Information: Operating hours, special events, Lightning Lane pricing, and evening shows
3. Today's Snapshot: Real-time summary of top waits, extremes, and closures
4. Current Wait Times: Top 5 attractions with highest wait times per park
5. Hourly Trends: Wait time patterns for top attractions throughout the day
6. Historical Analysis: Day-of-week and hour-of-day wait time patterns

## Configuration

### Park Configuration

```python
parks = {
    "Magic Kingdom": {"color": "#FF4D00"},
    "Epcot": {"color": "#0080FF"},
    "Hollywood Studios": {"color": "#FF6EC7"},
    "Animal Kingdom": {"color": "#4CAF50"}
}
```

### Evening Shows Mapping

```python
evening_shows = {
    "Magic Kingdom": "Happily Ever After",
    "Epcot": "Luminous The Symphony of Us",
    "Hollywood Studios": "Fantasmic!",
    "Animal Kingdom": "Tree of Life Awakenings"
}
```

### Auto-Refresh Settings

* Refresh Interval: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
* Data Reload: Complete park data refresh on each interval

## Data Processing

### Wait Time Processing

* Converts UTC timestamps to Eastern Time (Disney World timezone)
* Filters out wait times â‰¤ 1 minute to focus on meaningful waits
* Handles duplicate records by taking maximum wait time per attraction
* Rounds timestamps to nearest minute for consistent snapshots

### Analytics Processing

* Top 5 Analysis: Identifies attractions with highest current wait times
* Hourly Trends: Aggregates wait times by hour (7 AM - 11 PM)
* Day-of-Week Analysis: Historical averages across all seven days
* Operating Status: Calculates percentage of attractions currently operating

## Customization

### Adding New Parks

1. Add park to `parks` dictionary with unique color
2. Add evening show to `evening_shows` dictionary
3. Ensure database contains entities for the new park

### Modifying Refresh Rate

```python
dcc.Interval(
    id='interval-component',
    interval=300 * 1000,  # Change this value (in milliseconds)
    n_intervals=0
)
```

### Customizing Charts

* Colors are automatically generated using the `generate_colors()` function
* Chart styling can be modified in individual callback functions
* Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

## API Integration

### OpenWeatherMap

* Provides current weather conditions for Disney World area
* Displays temperature, "feels like" temperature, and weather description
* Updates with dashboard refresh cycle

### Future API Integrations

* Disney's official APIs (when available)
* Third-party wait time services
* Social media sentiment analysis
* Crowd calendar integrations

## Performance Considerations

* Database Optimization: Indexes recommended on timestamp, entity\_id, and park columns
* Memory Management: Large datasets are processed in chunks
* Caching: Consider implementing Redis for frequently accessed data
* Concurrent Users: Dash can handle multiple concurrent users, but consider load balancing for high traffic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Database Connection Errors

   * Verify database path is correct
   * Ensure database file has proper permissions
   * Check that all required tables exist
2. Missing Data

   * Verify data ingestion pipeline is running
   * Check for timezone conversion issues
   * Ensure entity types match expected values
3. Chart Display Issues

   * Clear browser cache
   * Check console for JavaScript errors
   * Verify Plotly version compatibility

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for development:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8051, debug=True)
```
